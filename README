NULL Deref Detector
===================

1. Overview

NULL Deref Detector (NDD) is a Valgrind tool that does more than the
Valgrind "none" tool. NDD can detect cases of null dereferencing bugs
in C programs at runtime.

Dereferencing a null pointer in C is undefined behavior and it is not
guaranteed that it leads to a "segmentation fault", see:
http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html

As an example, suppose you have the following C program:

#include <stddef.h>

struct st {
    int x;
};

int main(void)
{
    struct st *s = NULL;
    return s->x;
}

If you compile the program and run it like follows:

$ make -C example null_deref
$ valgrind --tool=ndd example/null_deref

it should produce:

==14526== NDD-0.1, a minimal null dereference checker
==14526== Copyright (C) 2010, 2011, and GNU GPL'd, by Stephan Creutz.
==14526== Using Valgrind-3.6.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==14526== Command: bugs/null_deref
==14526==
==14526== load from null pointer detected
==14526==    at 0x4004A4: main (null_deref.c:10)

2. How to install

To compile Valgrind with NDD two helper scripts are
provided. "export_valgrind.sh" exports the most recent version of
Valgrind to the subdirectory "valgrind".

"compile_ndd.sh" patches Valgrind's source for NDD, compiles its
source and finally installs it.

Both shell scripts are POSIX compliant and should work with all POSIX
compliant shells like dash, bash, zsh, otherwise I consider this as a
bug.

Contributions, like patches and ideas are welcome.
